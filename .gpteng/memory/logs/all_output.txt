================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

================================ Human Message =================================

Request: APIシステムからのテストですAPIシステムからのテストです

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on your request, I will implement a simple API system using Python and Flask. Here is the implementation:

**requirements.txt**
```
Flask==2.0.1
pytest==6.2.5
dataclasses==0.7
```

**app/__init__.py**
```
# Initialize the Flask app
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
```

**app/config.py**
```
# Configuration file
class Config:
    """Configuration class"""
    DEBUG = True
    TESTING = True
    SECRET_KEY = 'secret_key_here'
```

**app/models.py**
```
# Data models
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class User:
    """User data model"""
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str

@dataclass
class Product:
    """Product data model"""
    id: int
    name: str
    price: float
```

**app/routes.py**
```
# API routes
from flask import Blueprint, jsonify, request
from app.models import User, Product

api = Blueprint('api', __name__)

@api.route('/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
    """Get all users"""
    users = [User(id=1, name='John Doe', email='john@example.com'), User(id=2, name='Jane Doe', email='jane@example.com')]
    return jsonify([user.__dict__ for user in users])

@api.route('/products', methods=['GET'])
def get_products():
    """Get all products"""
    products = [Product(id=1, name='Product 1', price=10.99), Product(id=2, name='Product 2', price=9.99)]
    return jsonify([product.__dict__ for product in products])

@api.route('/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_user(user_id):
    """Get a user by ID"""
    user = User(id=user_id, name='John Doe', email='john@example.com')
    return jsonify(user.__dict__)

@api.route('/products/<int:product_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_product(product_id):
    """Get a product by ID"""
    product = Product(id=product_id, name='Product 1', price=10.99)
    return jsonify(product.__dict__)
```

**app/app.py**
```
# Main application file
from flask import Flask
from app.config import Config
from app.routes import api

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(Config)

app.register_blueprint(api)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

**tests/test_app.py**
```
# Test file
import pytest
from app.app import app

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client

def test_get_users(client):
    """Test getting all users"""
    response = client.get('/users')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert len(response.json) == 2

def test_get_products(client):
    """Test getting all products"""
    response = client.get('/products')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert len(response.json) == 2

def test_get_user(client):
    """Test getting a user by ID"""
    response = client.get('/users/1')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json['id'] == 1

def test_get_product(client):
    """Test getting a product by ID"""
    response = client.get('/products/1')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json['id'] == 1
```

This concludes a fully working implementation of a simple API system using Flask and Python.
